# Unparagoned

UNPARAGONED is a Java natural language processing program that reads a text file and recognizes patterns in the language. Simplified Markov chains represented by hashtables record the frequency of successive words for any given word. This data is used to produce sample text with similar language patterns. This program is seen in predictive typing like keyboard auto-complete features.
